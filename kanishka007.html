        <h1>Satyendra Nath Bose</h1>
        <img src="image/SatyenBose.jpg">
        <p><strong>Born:</strong> January 1, 1894</p>
        <p><strong>Died:</strong> February 4, 1974</p>
        <p><strong>Nationality:</strong> Indian</p>

        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>Satyendra Nath Bose was born in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India. He completed his B.Sc. from the University of Calcutta in 1913 and earned his M.Sc. in 1915. He later obtained a D.Sc. degree from the same university in 1926.</p>
        Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven children in a Bengali Kayastha family.[11] He was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home. When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School. In his final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu School. He passed his entrance examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood fifth in the order of merit. He then joined the intermediate science course at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers included Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray.

        Bose received a Bachelor of Science in mixed mathematics from Presidency College, standing first in 1913. Then he joined Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee's newly formed Science College where he again stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in 1915. His marks in the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.[12]
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Bose worked as a professor of physics at the University of Dhaka from 1921 to 1945. He later returned to India and served at the University of Calcutta.</p>
        He is best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in developing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 1954 by the Government of India.
        <h2>Contributions  of satyendranath bose</h2>
        <p>Bose is best known for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly for his development of Bose-Einstein statistics. He collaborated with Albert Einstein in 1924 to extend the idea of statistical mechanics to particles with integer spin, now known as bosons.</p>
        What was the major contribution of S N Bose? Satyendra Nath Bose is revered as the great Indian theoretical physicist renowned for his work on quantum mechanics. His area of research was the theory of relativity. In 1924, he derived Planck's quantum radiation law in a paper without reference to classical physics.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Satyendra Nath Bose's contributions to physics have had a lasting impact. The term "boson" is named in his honor, and his work laid the foundation for various fields in quantum physics and cosmology.</p>
        He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is found to be of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely to the development of nuclear physics
        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Bose was married to Sunanda Bose and had four children. He was known for his humility and dedication to science.</p>
        the eldest of seven children in a Bengali Kayastha family.His father, Surendranath Bose, worked in the Engineering Department of the East Indian Railway Company. In 1914, at age 20, Satyendra Nath Bose married Ushabati Ghosh,[3][13] the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent Calcutta physician.[14] They had nine offspring, two of whom died in early childhood. When he died in 1974, he left behind his wife, two sons, and five daughters.[12]

        As a polyglot, Bose was well versed in several languages such as Bengali, English, French, German and Sanskrit as well as the poetry of Lord Tennyson, Rabindranath Tagore and Kalidasa. He could play the esraj, an Indian instrument similar to a violin.[15] He was actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as the Working Men's Institute.[7][16 He was the only son, with six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency. His schooling began at the age of five, near his home.
